Code written with Professor Youngren for Multivariable Calculus for Engineers and Applied Scientists

All these files are Jupyter Notebooks; the main file is Estimating 3-D Functions with Riemann Sums.ipynb; for clarity purposes, this main file use of the other files through imports.

The main goal of these files is to visualize estimating the integration of a 3-D surface. Part of this document provides useful code for visualizing the integration of a known function which represents a 3-D surface, and part provides useful code for visualizing the integration of a surface whose function is not known. The latter part is a more difficult scenario, as often only certain points from a surface are known. However, using different mesh analysis techniques, it is possible to arrive at a relatively accurate solution, even if the function is not known.
